## Conclusion

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a proof-of-concept in realising the potential and exploring the feasibility of using the LeapMotion device for physical therapy. The project has made a program with different kinds of games to appeal to a wider audience of difference age groups. It is also possible to further add more games in the future as well as make improvements to the gesture controls to allow for more effective physical therapy to take place in the future. The three games implemented in this project each have a unique motion gesture to represent the different levels of difficulty as the physical therapy progresses. The use of open-source and readily available technologies also proves that it is possible without needing an extraordinary effort or high cost to create systems and devices to make use of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in physical therapy. It is only a matter of time before we start to see purpose-built systems being used for physical therapy treatment. The group would like to put forward an acknowledgement to Vic Ciesielski for giving us this opportunity to explore and learn about HCI in the medical arena and also thanks to Ibrahim Khalil for supervising the group throughout the duration of this project and for the useful feedback provided.
